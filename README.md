Hruday Chilukuri - 24JE0273

Methods I implemented in algorithms made in the library
For,
  Linear Regression : Calculation of Gradient Descent to Plot the Suitable Curve
  Polynomial Regression : Calculation of Gradient Descent to Plot the Suitable Curve
  Logistic Regression : Usage of Sigmoid Function with a Threshold of 0.5
  K- Nearest Neighbor : Usage of K-Nearest Neighbour with K = 3 
  K - Means clustering : Euclidean Distance (Tried Manhattan Distance Also)
  Decision Trees
  N-Neural Network

I experimented and played with:-
For,
   Linear Regression : Played with Epochs, Found best Learning Rate, Used MSE and R2 to find errors.
   Polynomial Regression : I changed the degree "N" of the equations, Learning Rate and Played with Epochs (Iterations)
   Logistic Regression : Usage of Sigmoid/Other Functions like Grad Descent, Epochs, Cross Entropy for best Accuracy
   K- Nearest Neighbors : Changed the Number of K with 2,3,4 and then Epochs and found F1 Score
   K Means Clustering : Used Euclidean/Manhattan/Minkowski Distances and changed between K's and found K = 2 to be bast for given data.
   Decision Tree : Changed the Minimum Split, Maximum Depth, Used Gini rather than Entropy as it takes less time to process
   N Neural Network : Played with number of layers, like 3 Layer Neural Network, etc.
